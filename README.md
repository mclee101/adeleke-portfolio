## 👋 Hi, I'm Adeleke

A data-driven analyst transforming discrepancies into revelations blending SAP FI workflows with analytics to unlock smarter decisions 
It started with matching invoices,payment runs, setting up new supplier accounts  and reconciliations of accounts in SAP FI but I couldn’t stop questioning the patterns behind the numbers. What causes delays? Where’s the risk? Why do certain vendors spike in Q4? That curiosity turned into a passion for data, and I’ve been uncovering insights ever since.

Now I use **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Excel**, and **Tableau** to:
- 🧹 Clean, structure, and enrich messy financial data  
- 📊 Build dashboards that reveal trends, risks, and opportunities  
- 🔮 Forecast performance and uncover patterns using historical data  
- 🧠 Detect duplicate payments, fraud, and process inefficiencies  
- 🛠 Solve workflow challenges with insight-driven solutions  
- 🔍 Empower finance teams to act with clarity and confidence
